/**
// The following are various constants that describe the shapes and sizes of
// S2Cells (see s2coords.h and s2cell_id.h).  They are useful for deciding
// which cell level to use in order to satisfy a given condition (e.g. that
// cell vertices must be no further than "x" apart).  All of the raw constants
// are differential quantities; you can use the GetValue(level) method to
// compute the corresponding length or area on the unit sphere for cells at a
// given level.  The minimum and maximum bounds are valid for cells at all
// levels, but they may be somewhat conservative for very large cells
// (e.g. face cells).
 *
 * Defines a cell metric of the given dimension (1 == length, 2 == area).
 *
 * @property dim The metric dimension (1 == length, 2 == area).
 * @property deriv The "deriv" value of a metric is a derivative, and must be multiplied by a length or area in
 * (s,t)-space to get a useful value.
