/**
 * This class allows edges to be efficiently tested for intersection with a given fixed edge AB.  It is especially
 * efficient when testing for intersection with an edge chain connecting vertices v0, v1, v2, ...
 *
 * Example usage:
 *
 *   fun countIntersections(a: S2Point, b: S2Point, edges: List<Pair<S2Point, S2Point>>) {
 *     val count: Int = 0
 *     val crosser = S2EdgeCrosser(a, b)
 *     for (edge : edges) {
 *       if (crosser.crossingSign(edge.first, edge.second) >= 0) {
 *         ++count;
 *       }
 *     }
 *     return count;
 *   }
 *
 * This class expects that the client already has all the necessary vertices stored in memory, so that this class can
 * refer to them with pointers and does not need to make its own copies.  If this is not the case (e.g., you
 * want to pass temporary objects as vertices), see S2CopyingEdgeCrosser.
 *
 * @constructor Default constructor; must be followed by a call to init().
