    // that have been displaced by up to kIntersectionError are merged back
    // together again.  For example this can happen when geometry is intersected
    // with a set of tiles and then unioned.  It is equal to twice the

    // Properties of CrossingSign:
    //
    //  (1) CrossingSign(b,a,c,d) == CrossingSign(a,b,c,d)
    //  (2) CrossingSign(c,d,a,b) == CrossingSign(a,b,c,d)

    //
    // This function implements an exact, consistent perturbation model such
    // that no three points are ever considered to be collinear.  This means
    // that even if you have 4 points A, B, C, D that lie exactly in a line
    // (say, around the equator), C and D will be treated as being slightly to
    // one side or the other of AB.  This is done in a way such that the
    // results are always consistent (see s2pred::Sign).

    // it is much more efficient to use an S2EdgeCrosser (see s2edge_crosser.h).

    // Given two edges AB and CD where at least two vertices are identical
    // (i.e. CrossingSign(a,b,c,d) == 0), this function defines whether the
    // two edges "cross" in a such a way that point-in-polygon containment tests
    // can be implemented by counting the number of edge crossings.  The basic
    // rule is that a "crossing" occurs if AB is encountered after CD during a
    // CCW sweep around the shared vertex starting from a fixed reference point.
    //
    // Note that according to this rule, if AB crosses CD then in general CD
    // does not cross AB.  However, this leads to the correct result when
    // counting polygon edge crossings.  For example, suppose that A,B,C are
    // three consecutive vertices of a CCW polygon.  If we now consider the edge
    // crossings of a segment BP as P sweeps around B, the crossing number
    // changes parity exactly when BP crosses BA or BC.

        //    projection and interpolation, taking care to minimize cancellation
        //    error.  This method exists in "double" and "long double" versions.
        //
        //  - GetIntersectionExact() computes the intersection point using exact
        //    arithmetic and converts the final result back to an S2Point.
        //
        // We don't actually use the first method (GetIntersectionSimple) because it
