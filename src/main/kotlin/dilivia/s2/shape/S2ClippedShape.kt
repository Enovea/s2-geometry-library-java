package dilivia.s2.shape

// S2ClippedShape represents the part of a shape that intersects an S2Cell.
// It consists of the set of edge ids that intersect that cell, and a boolean
// indicating whether the center of the cell is inside the shape (for shapes
// that have an interior).
//
// Note that the edges themselves are not clipped; we always use the original
// edges for intersection tests so that the results will be the same as the
// original shape.
// @property shapeId The shape id of the clipped shape.
