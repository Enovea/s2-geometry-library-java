// The purpose of S2Shape is to represent polygonal geometry in a flexible
// way.  It is organized as a collection of edges that optionally defines an
// interior.  All geometry represented by an S2Shape must have the same
// dimension, which means that an S2Shape can represent either a set of
// points, a set of polylines, or a set of polygons.
//
// S2Shape is defined as an abstract base class in order to give clients
// control over the underlying data representation.  Sometimes an S2Shape does
// not have any data of its own, but instead "wraps" some other class.  There
// are various useful subtypes defined in *_shape.h, and some S2 classes also
// have a nested "Shape" class (e.g., S2Polygon::Shape).  It is easy for
// clients to implement their own subtypes, since the interface is minimal.
//
// S2Shape operations are typically defined on S2ShapeIndex objects rather
// than individual shapes.  An S2ShapeIndex is simply a collection of
// S2Shapes, possibly of different dimensions (e.g. 10 points and 3 polygons),
// organized into a data structure for efficient edge access.
//
// The edges of an S2Shape are identified by a contiguous range of "edge ids"
// starting at 0.  The edges are further subdivided into "chains", where each
// chain consists of a sequence of edges connected end-to-end (a polyline).
// For example, an S2Shape representing two polylines AB and CDE would have
// three edges (AB, CD, DE) grouped into two chains: (AB) and (CD, DE).
// Similarly, an S2Shape representing 5 points would have 5 chains consisting
// of one edge each.
//
// S2Shape has methods that allow edges to be accessed either using the global
// numbering (edge id) or within a particular chain.  The global numbering is
// sufficient for most purposes, but the chain representation is useful for
// certain algorithms such as intersection (see S2BooleanOperation).

    //  1 - Polyline geometry.  Polyline edges may be degenerate.  A shape may
    //      represent any number of polylines.  Polylines edges may intersect.
    //
    //  2 - Polygon geometry.  Edges should be oriented such that the polygon
    //      interior is always on the left.  In theory the edges may be returned
    //      in any order, but typically the edges are organized as a collection
    //      of edge chains where each chain represents one polygon loop.
    //      Polygons may have degeneracies (e.g., degenerate edges or sibling
    //      pairs consisting of an edge and its corresponding reversed edge).
    //      A polygon loop may also be full (containing all points on the
    //      sphere); by convention this is represented as a chain with no edges.
    //      (See S2LaxPolygonShape for details.)

    // to be distinguished, e.g. it allows a point to be distinguished from a
    // polyline or polygon that has been simplified to a single point.

    // Virtual methods that return pointers of your choice.  These methods are
    // intended to help with the problem of attaching additional data to S2Shape
    // objects.  For example, you could return a pointer to a source object, or
    // a pointer to a bundle of additional data allocated with the S2Shape.
    // Because this method exists in all S2Shapes, you can override it in each
    // type of shape you have and call it without knowing the concrete subtype.
    // For example, if you have polyline and polygon shapes, you can do this:
    //
    //   class MyPolyline : public S2Polyline::Shape {
    //    public:
    //     virtual void* mutable_user_data() { return &my_data_; }
    //    private:
    //     MyData my_data_;
    //   };
    //   class MyPolygon : public S2Polygon::Shape {
    //    public:
    //     virtual void* mutable_user_data() { return &my_data_; }
    //    private:
    //     MyData my_data_;

    //   ...
    //   S2Shape* shape = index.shape(id);
    //   const MyData* data = static_cast<const MyData*>(shape->user_data());
    //
    // This is not the only way to map from an S2Shape back to your source
    // data.  Other reasonable techniques include:
    //
    //  - Every shape has an id() assigned by S2ShapeIndex.  Ids are assigned
    //    sequentially starting from 0 in the order the shapes are added to the
    //    index.  You can use this id to look up arbitrary data stored in your
    //    own vector.
    //
    //  - If all of your shapes are the same type, then you can create your own
    //    subclass of some existing S2Shape type (such as S2Polyline::Shape) and
    //    add your own methods and fields.  You can access this data by
    //    downcasting the S2Shape pointers returned by S2ShapeIndex methods.
