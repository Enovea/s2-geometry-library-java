// MutableS2ShapeIndex is a class for in-memory indexing of polygonal geometry.
// The objects in the index are known as "shapes", and may consist of points,
// polylines, and/or polygons, possibly overlapping.  The index makes it very
// fast to answer queries such as finding nearby shapes, measuring distances,
// testing for intersection and containment, etc.
//
// MutableS2ShapeIndex allows not only building an index, but also updating it
// incrementally by adding or removing shapes (hence its name).  It is one of
// several implementations of the S2ShapeIndex interface.  MutableS2ShapeIndex
// is designed to be compact; usually it is smaller than the underlying
// geometry being indexed.  It is capable of indexing up to hundreds of
// millions of edges.  The index is also fast to construct.
//
// There are a number of built-in classes that work with S2ShapeIndex objects.
// Generally these classes accept any collection of geometry that can be
// represented by an S2ShapeIndex, i.e. any combination of points, polylines,
// and polygons.  Such classes include:
//
// - S2ContainsPointQuery: returns the shape(s) that contain a given point.
//
// - S2ClosestEdgeQuery: returns the closest edge(s) to a given point, edge,
//                       S2CellId, or S2ShapeIndex.
//
// - S2CrossingEdgeQuery: returns the edge(s) that cross a given edge.
//
// - S2BooleanOperation: computes boolean operations such as union,
//                       and boolean predicates such as containment.
//
// - S2ShapeIndexRegion: computes approximations for a collection of geometry.
//
// - S2ShapeIndexBufferedRegion: computes approximations that have been
//                               expanded by a given radius.
//
// Here is an example showing how to build an index for a set of polygons, and
// then then determine which polygon(s) contain each of a set of query points:
//
//   void TestContainment(const vector<S2Point>& points,
//                        const vector<S2Polygon*>& polygons) {
//     MutableS2ShapeIndex index
//     for (auto polygon : polygons) {
//       index.Add(absl::make_unique<S2Polygon::Shape>(polygon))
//     }
//     auto query = MakeS2ContainsPointQuery(&index)
//     for (const auto& point : points) {
//       for (S2Shape* shape : query.GetContainingShapes(point)) {
//         S2Polygon* polygon = polygons[shape->id()]
//         ... do something with (point, polygon) ...
//       }
//     }
//   }
//
// This example uses S2Polygon::Shape, which is one example of an S2Shape
// object.  S2Polyline and S2Loop also have nested Shape classes, and there are
// additional S2Shape types defined in *_shape.h.
//
// Internally, MutableS2ShapeIndex is essentially a map from S2CellIds to the
// set of shapes that intersect each S2CellId.  It is adaptively refined to
// ensure that no cell contains more than a small number of edges.
//
// For efficiency, updates are batched together and applied lazily on the
// first subsequent query.  Locking is used to ensure that MutableS2ShapeIndex
// has the same thread-safety properties as "vector": const methods are
// thread-safe, while non-const methods are not thread-safe.  This means that
// if one thread updates the index, you must ensure that no other thread is
// reading or updating the index at the same time.
//
// TODO(ericv): MutableS2ShapeIndex has an Encode() method that allows the
// index to be serialized.  An encoded S2ShapeIndex can be decoded either into
// its original form (MutableS2ShapeIndex) or into an EncodedS2ShapeIndex.
// The key property of EncodedS2ShapeIndex is that it can be constructed
// instantaneously, since the index is kept in its original encoded form.
// Data is decoded only when an operation needs it.  For example, to determine
// which shapes(s) contain a given query point only requires decoding the data
// in the S2ShapeIndexCell that contains that point.
// @constructor
// Create a MutableS2ShapeIndex with the given options.
// Creates a MutableS2ShapeIndex that uses the default option settings.
// Option values may be changed by calling Init().
// @property otions
// The options supplied for this index.

    // query times can increase substantially, especially for algorithms that
    // visit all pairs of potentially intersecting edges (such as polygon
    // validation), since this is quadratic in the number of edges per cell.
    //
    // Note that the *average* number of edges per cell is generally slightly

    // While it would be possible to combine all the edge information into one

    //  - Memory usage.  Separating the two classes means that we only need to

    //    subdivided, and it also lets us delay computing bounding boxes until
    //    they are needed for processing each face (when the dataset spans
    //    multiple faces).
    //
    //  - Performance.  UpdateEdges is significantly faster on large polygons when
    //    the data is separated, because it often only needs to access the data in
    //    ClippedEdge and this data is cached more successfully.

    //     + Applications that load a database of geometry and then query only
