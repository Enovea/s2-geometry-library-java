/**
 * S2ShapeIndex is an abstract base class for indexing polygonal geometry. The objects in the index are known as
 * "shapes", and may consist of points, polylines, and/or polygons, possibly overlapping.  The index makes it very fast
 * to answer queries such as finding nearby shapes, measuring distances, testing for intersection and containment, etc.
 *
 * Each object in the index implements the S2Shape interface. An S2Shape is a collection of edges that optionally
 * defines an interior. The edges do not need to be connected, so for example an S2Shape can represent a polygon
 * with multiple shells and/or holes, or a set of polylines, or a set of points.
 *
 * All geometry within a single S2Shape must have the same dimension, so for example if you want to create an
 * S2ShapeIndex containing a polyline and 10 points, then you will need at least two different S2Shape objects.
 *
 * The most important type of S2ShapeIndex is MutableS2ShapeIndex, which allows you to build an index incrementally by
 * adding or removing shapes.
 *
 * There are a number of built-in classes that work with S2ShapeIndex objects. Generally these classes accept any
 * collection of geometry that can be represented by an S2ShapeIndex, i.e. any combination of points, polylines,
 * and polygons.  Such classes include:
 *
 * - S2ContainsPointQuery: returns the shape(s) that contain a given point.
 * - S2ClosestEdgeQuery: returns the closest edge(s) to a given point, edge, S2CellId, or S2ShapeIndex.
 * - S2CrossingEdgeQuery: returns the edge(s) that cross a given edge.
 * - S2BooleanOperation: computes boolean operations such as union, and boolean predicates such as containment.
 * - S2ShapeIndexRegion: computes approximations for a collection of geometry.
 * - S2ShapeIndexBufferedRegion: computes approximations that have been expanded by a given radius.
 *
 * Here is an example showing how to index a set of polygons and then
 * determine which polygon(s) contain each of a set of query points:
 *
 * <pre>
 *   fun testContainment(points: List<S2Point>, polygons: List<S2Polygon>) {
 *     val index = MutableS2ShapeIndex()
 *     for (polygon in polygons) {
 *       index.add(polygon)
 *     }
 *     val query = makeS2ContainsPointQuery(index)
 *     for (point in points) {
 *       for (shape : query.getContainingShapes(point)) {
 *         val polygon = polygons[shape.id()]
 *         ... do something with (point, polygon) ...
 *       }
 *     }
 *   }
 * </pre>
 *
 * This example uses S2Polygon.Shape, which is one example of an S2Shape object. S2Polyline and S2Loop also have
 * nested Shape classes, and there are additional S2Shape types defined in *Shape.kt
 *
 * Internally, an S2ShapeIndex is essentially a map from S2CellIds to the set of shapes that intersect each S2CellId.
 * It is adaptively refined to ensure that no cell contains more than a small number of edges.
 *
 * In addition to implementing a set of abstract methods, all S2ShapeIndex subtypes define an Iterator type with the
 * same API. This makes it easy to convert code that uses a particular S2ShapeIndex subtype to instead use the abstract
 * base class (or vice versa).
